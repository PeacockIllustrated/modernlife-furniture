# DESIGN.md — Modern Life Furniture, design system v2

The working reference for the clean commercial store. It supersedes the
museum-gallery system; `reference/concept-v5.html` is history, not authority.
CLAUDE.md carries the intent; this file carries the values.

## Concept
A premium direct-to-consumer store in our own voice. Photography leads, type
is confident and quiet, surfaces are flat, shapes are softly rounded, motion
is light. Every band is designed around an image slot managed from the
dashboard; the generative line drawings survive only as quiet placeholders
until photography exists and as small brand accents. Never design a section
that only works with the drawing.

## Tokens (app/globals.css, `:root`)
```css
--paper:  #F5F3EF;  /* page ground                    */
--panel:  #EAE7E1;  /* panel tone, tonal blocks       */
--stone:      var(--paper);  /* legacy alias, keep     */
--stone-deep: var(--panel);  /* legacy alias, keep     */
--ink:    #1E211E;  /* text on light                  */
--basalt: #151C18;  /* dark bands and footer          */
--bone:   #DDD9CC;  /* text on dark                   */
--amber:  #C97B3D;  /* single brand accent; also the "prepared" status */
--rose:   #B4685E;  /* status only: reserved, sold    */
--sea:    #5E7A6B;  /* status only: available         */
--hair-colour: rgba(30,33,30,.16);
--hair: 1px solid var(--hair-colour);
--radius-s: 6px;    /* inputs, selects, textareas, small elements */
--radius-m: 12px;   /* cards, figures, tonal blocks   */
--shadow-float: 0 8px 24px rgba(30,33,30,.12); /* floating elements only */
```
Status colours are data, not decoration. The legacy `--stone` aliases exist so
older rules keep working; new work should reference `--paper` and `--panel`.

## Shape
- Pill buttons everywhere: `border-radius: 999px` on `.enquire`, `.btn`,
  `.btn-solid`, `.btn-line`, `.highlight-all`, `.featured-cta`,
  `.interest-open`, and form submits. Comfortable horizontal padding,
  palette-inversion hover kept from v1.
- `--radius-s` on inputs, selects and textareas.
- `--radius-m` on cards and figures that hold images or canvases, always with
  `overflow: hidden`: `.featured-figure`, `.room-tile-figure`,
  `.promo-figure`, `.cat-row-figure`, `.piece-figure`, `.enquire-panel`,
  `.enquire-aside`, `.block`, `.acquire`. The photo hero panel rounds only
  its free corner.
- `--shadow-float` is for floating elements only (sticky bars, the mobile
  enquiry bar). Flat surfaces carry no shadow.
- Full-bleed bands (`.category-band`, `.feature`, `.buying`) stay square;
  rounding belongs to elements that sit inside a ground, not to the grounds.

## Type
- Display: Fraunces, weight 300 (400 for card h3s), italic for the one
  emphasis word (the "Checked, documented, *delivered*" pattern). Loaded via
  next/font.
- Body and UI: Archivo 400/500.
- Mono (Spline Sans Mono) is demoted to small metadata only: eyebrows,
  counters, prices, status lines, nav, footer columns.
- Sentence case everywhere, including nav and buttons.

## Layout rhythm
- Content capped at `--shell` (1200px) and centred via `--edge-pad`;
  backgrounds run full bleed.
- Whitespace is generous, one idea per band. Alternate paper and panel
  grounds with an occasional basalt band (buying band, feature closers,
  footer top strip) for rhythm; hairlines structure the inside of a ground.
- Chairs lead: nav first link, hero primary CTA, first tile in the category
  row, first row of the collection index.
- Header: a plain fixed bar on paper, slightly translucent with backdrop
  blur, bottom hairline. The v1 difference blend is retired; it fought the
  light commercial ground and the photography.
- The announcement strip sits in normal flow beneath the header and scrolls
  away; its top padding keeps its line clear of the fixed bar.

## Photography
Photography leads every card, hero and band, through slots managed in the
dashboard (hero image, buying band image, per-piece galleries). Every slot
falls back to the category's generative study over a plinth so no section
ever renders empty. next/image everywhere with real `sizes`.

Note for whoever next touches `components/canvas`: the canvas renderers still
paint their ground as the v1 stone `#E4E2DB`. On the new paper it reads as a
near-panel tone inside the framed figures, which passes, but the constants
should move to `--panel` (`#EAE7E1`) when that layer is next open.

## Motion, light touch
- The section reveal (26px rise) and eased canvas interactions survive;
  nothing new that costs conversion or Lighthouse.
- Every canvas pauses off-screen, devicePixelRatio capped at 2, and canvases
  that listen to pointer input carry `touch-action: pan-y`.
- `prefers-reduced-motion` renders everything at rest with nothing missing.
- Keyboard focus visible on all interactive elements; tap targets 44px
  minimum.
